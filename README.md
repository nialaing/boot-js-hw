Bootstrap and JS/jQ Homework

With this assignment, I have completed:
1. getting my rows and columns in order

I am still working through:
1. getting my boxes to appear
2. getting my buttons
3. writing my js code

A huge challenge is:
1. figuring out why my github.io site link for this repo is giving me a 404 error
